# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My recent research focuses on data sketching and sampling. These techniques drastically reduce the size of Big Data and allow users to extract approximate answers from in-memory summaries that are constructed in one-pass over the original data.

My research is in statistics, databases, and machine learning. In particular, my recent work is primarily on the topic of data sketching. These are techniques for approximate query processing where a stream of Big Data is compressed into a small memory summary that can be queried quickly and provide answers to a range of questions. It lies in the intersection of statistics, databases, and algorithms. I also work on manifold learning.

In the past, I worked on online experimentation at FB where I helped start and build the experiment analysis platform Deltoid. My past research also included non-parametric Bayesian methods and data privacy.
